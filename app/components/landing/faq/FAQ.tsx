    question: "Will ResumeAI rewrite my entire resume?",

      "No. ResumeAI improves your existing resume by rewriting bullet points, optimizing ATS keywords, and tailoring it for each job while preserving your actual experience and achievements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my resume pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)?",
    answer:
      "ResumeAI analyzes your resume against a job description and recommends improvements commonly associated with stronger ATS compatibility. Because employers use different ATS platforms, no tool can guarantee passing every system.",
  },

      "Yes. Create and save multiple tailored versions of your resume for different companies and roles, making every application more relevant without starting from scratch.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to upload my resume every time?",
    answer:
      "No. Upload your resume once, then reuse it to generate tailored versions for as many job descriptions as you like.",

    question: "Which file formats are supported?",
    answer:
      "ResumeAI supports PDF and DOCX uploads and exports, making it easy to edit, download, and submit your resume wherever you're applying.",
